# Feed Reader Testing

In this project, we use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a test suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## Functionality

We write a number of tests under **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** in order to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Instructions

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository or download as a ZIP.
2. Go into the working dircectory.
3. Run a local server. I personally prefer [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/).
4. Navigate to index.html in your preferred browser (**./index.html**).
5. Jasmine testing results will be displayed at the bottom of the page as shown in the following image.
